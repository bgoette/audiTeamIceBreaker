Professor Mehlhase was ordering one last round from the Biergarten even though she was supposed to be at the Flughafen to get back to ASU!

But on the way she started playing Musik with Bratwurst and Brot as drumsticks and her Porsche as a drum kit.

As she drove past the Dirndel shop she saw an Audi covered in Lederhose...and became wettbewerbsfaehig!

It was always her dream to see Guass rocking with Rammstein on the Hauptstrasse.

She turned on the Klimaanlage but nearly hit a BMW that seem to come out of nowhere!

She also had forgoten her favorite Lederhose in the Ratskeller!

To make up for it, she stopped by the most expensive clothing store in Berlin and bought a new Dirndel.

Klimaanlage was blasting in Audi as she drove through Berlin!
