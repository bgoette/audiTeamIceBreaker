Professor Mehlhase was ordering one last round from the Biergarten even though she was supposed to be at the Flughafen to get back to ASU!  

But on the way she started playing Musik with Bratwurst and Brot as drumsticks and her Porsche as a drum kit.

As she drove past the Dirndel shop she saw an Audi covered in Lederhose...and became wettbewerbsfaehig!

It was always her dream to see Guass rocking with Rammstein on the Hauptstrasse.
