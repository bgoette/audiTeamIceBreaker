Professor Mehlhase was ordering one last round from the Biergarten even though she was supposed to be at the Flughafen to get back to ASU!  
But on the way she started playing Musik with Bratwurst and Brot as drumsticks and her Porsche as a drum kit.
She was strolling down the Hauptstrasse in her Dirndel!
Klimaanlage was blasting in Audi as she drove through Berlin!
